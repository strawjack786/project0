It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries.There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes.
